# Note

This is a repo followed instructions from [Transformerjs Building a React Application Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/tutorials/react). The current Transformer version is 2 --> It has a [bug](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/issues/366) regarding caching model

Seems like ver 3 will fix it
